    <p class="text-center">Chef Nelson studied at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. During a phase of eating frozen pizzas, he decided that there had to be a better way. He began by purchasing a pizza stone and then a paella pan. He then bought some very expensive knives and began watching YouTube videos to learn how to cook. Now awarded three Michelin stars, Chef Nelson looks to take the restaurant industry by storm. </p>
